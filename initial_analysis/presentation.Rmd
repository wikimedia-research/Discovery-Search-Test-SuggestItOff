## TL;DR

* The system works;
* [did the change work]
* Things are promising, but we have some work to do before the next test.

## The Test

* We wanted to reduce the rate of zero results.
* One way of doing this is to reduce the required "certainty" in a suggestion before Cirrus provides it to the user.
* Lower certainty == more results given!
* At the same time, we changed the smoothing algorithm to avoid giving *bad* results.

## The methodology

* 10% of the search sessions
* Half got the "control"; half got different smoothing algorithm + reduced certainty.
